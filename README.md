# diva-package

To use this use 

```
kurtosis run . --production
```

Use the `--production` mode!

## Notes
- can el cl genesis data of the participant be available
 - YES IT is available use `el-cl-genesis-data` as the artifact uuid
 - So you can always refer to it as this
 - Maybe ethereum package should return passed args; or for things that are malleable in DIVA
 - we do something like `chain_id = args.get("network_params", "default_value")`
